VULNERABILITY REPORT: Potential XSS Vulnerability

Severity: MEDIUM
Type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Description:
The application may be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks in the user profile page. User-supplied data could potentially be reflected back to the browser without proper sanitization.

Affected Area:
- User profile functionality
- Possibly in the display name or bio fields

Vulnerability Analysis:
When displaying user information, the application might not properly encode HTML entities. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in other users' browsers.

Theoretical Attack:
An attacker could potentially set their display name to:
```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

If the application doesn't sanitize this input, it could execute when other users view the attacker's profile.

Potential Impact:
- Session hijacking
- Credential theft
- Phishing attacks
- Malware distribution

Recommendations:
- Implement proper output encoding
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use framework-provided XSS protection

Note: This is a theoretical analysis based on common patterns. The actual vulnerability depends on the specific implementation details of the application.
